## AI-Powered Tutor for Learning a New Language

**LearnLanguage** is an interactive AI-driven language tutor that helps you practice vocabulary and phrases in a new language with minimal input. Simply provide a **concept** (a topic or instruction), and the system will generate a bilingual word list based on your request. You can then **listen** to the pronunciation of the words and phrases in your target language, making it easier to learn through auditory reinforcement. Finally, you can put your ortographic and/or phonological knowledge to the test in 'test mode'.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Translations**: Uses OpenAI's **GPT-4o** to generate relevant bilingual word lists.
- **Customizable Learning Experience**: You can specify:
  - The **concept** (topic) you want to learn.
  - The **number of items** (words/phrases/sentences).
  - The **difficulty level** (beginner to expert).
  - The **target language** (Spanish or Russian).
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration**: Uses **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech) to generate audio pronunciations.
- **Audio Playback**: Listen to the generated content directly through the built-in audio player.
- **Testing Mode**: Allows you to test your ortographical and/or phonological knowledge.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with **Tkinter**, allowing users to easily input concepts, view translations, and play audio.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Change font sizes, colors, and background themes to suit your preferences.
- **Low API Costs**: Very cheap OpenAI API calls ensure affordability while still leveraging powerful AI models (create '.env' file and insert 'OPENAI_KEY="personal key"').
